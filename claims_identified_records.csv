07a7949c-1042-567d-9413-0b5b9def2ad6,user hey matt miller curious what this id field from enterpret is its the only optional available for syncing via census is that something that was created when the bampb enterpret account was set up is it the email address agent every record feedback user or account in enterpret needs a unique identifier in this case we are asking for an id that can tell us whether a row is new or existing this id can be anything eg if you were using an export of data from salesforce you might use contactid as the identifier for users user sorry not totally following the instructions in census for selecting a sync key say that the column and field should have the same unique value so i was assuming somewhere in enterpret there is an id field created for each record that is defined as their email agent youre correct when the sync ran for the first time and these rows were added to the user table in enterpret each one had its id field populated with the user email user might be worth discussing live it seems that for census to sync a record to enterpret there has to be a match on our source email and enterpret id and im not familiar with what the enterpret id is or how its defined it obviously matches our source email or no records would sync user sorry i think i get it now my first sync was an update or create so those emails didnt map to any ids but they were created during the first sync user matt miller we now have our census sync set to update only because we only want to send data for customers that have feedback in enterpret but if a new customer feedback is added im assuming we wont have the enterpret user id available for syncing via census does that make sense agent im not sure i follow want to connect quickly to discuss user yep thatd be great,0,2024-01-08T18:30:32Z,Slack,RecordTypeConversation,0.0

44ab0185-d128-5c9b-b823-ca8705b7b015,user jack divita will enterpret continue creating new reasons ad infinitum im going through and doing the work to merge similar ones but curious if this will be a sisyphean task sweatsmile agent gt will enterpret continue creating new reasons ad infinitum yes we do refreshes every two weeks in order to capture insights from new product releases and trends from your users gt im going through and doing the work to merge similar ones but curious if this will be a sisyphean task sweatsmile nooooooo sweatsmile think of it more like weeding your garden than pushing your stone you are correct in that technically the list will continue to grow over time but i promise you that merging reasons together is incredibly high leverage to improve the quality of your instance and we are actively investing in better tooling to learn from the types of merges you make along with better automated deduplication user oh boy i appreciate the reframe but it sure feels like pushing a stone right now sweatsmile agent yeah thats fair i would be happy to help andor hear your feedback on what is time consuming about it today we want to make this process easier user the wait time to see the changes reflected in the dashboard isnt great since i feel like i still see the clutter while it processes on the backend its helpful that they turn grey the prediction of which reasons to merge is quite good the search works well and having both the search and the prediction feels quite effective there are so many reasons that have only been applied to ticket and which have very subtle name differences eg help inviting members vs help inviting members in notion vs help inviting members in notion workspace maybe for some products this would be a helpful distinction but some concept in the model of everything is going to be part of notion or part of a notion workspace you do not need to differentiate between these concepts could go a long way sometimes the customers dont use the same words as we would to describe a feature we get reasons with their wording and with our wording ive merged some of these to use our wording but i have a feeling that more will keep popping up with the customers wording would be great to clearly indicate these sorts of conversations are actually all about this concept label the reasons accordingly our clearest example is for a feature called allowed email domains which lets users automatically join a notion workspace as members in tickets this mostly shows up as complaints about i tried to add mailtoemailaddressemailaddress as a guest but they popped into being a member how do i fix it and the reason is called something like issue with unexpected guest adding behavior when im reviewing the dashboard i need to understand that our product is behaving properly and these are not bug reports ive relabeled for now to be more like help understanding allowed email domain feature since thats a category that will make more sense for our product teams agent elliya cutler thank you so much for this feedback looping in a couple folks from my team to make sure this doesnt go to waste vivek kaushal is our product manager and is designing our next generation of taxonomy you should start to see some changes in q vivek lets make sure we are taking in to account elliyas feedback ansup babu is our machine learning lead working on reason deduplication ansup can we run the new deduplication script on notions data i suspect it would be able to catch many of these examples provided by elliya arnav sharma is our cto fyi on some current pain points with managing the taxonomy user running a dedupe script would be incredibly helpful no rush slightlysmilingface appreciate you listening agent if we shared a spreadsheet offline sometime next week where you could go through and confirmdeny our automated suggested merges would that work user sure i was trustingfrustrated enough to just let you merge them sweatsmile,0,2024-04-12T17:26:45Z,Slack,RecordTypeConversation,1.0

2bcd495c-91a1-502b-a3ab-07bccc9cb5d3,user hi jack divita i was wondering if it was possible to measure the sentiment change within a ticket for example does a customer start with negative sentiment but has positive sentiment at the end of a ticket user do we ask for csat multiple times within a tickets lifecycle i thought we only ask it when the ticket is closed user nope we only ask for the csat hours after the ticket is solved for email twitter tickets will receive the csat every time the ticket is solved but we can adjust as needed user nice is what enterpret calls sentiment different from csat i thought they were the same user i was looking at the customer sentiment throughout the entire ticket not their csat survey the thought behind this one is that wed be able to find tickets tickets where the support team turned the customers interaction around user right so what enterpret calls sentiment is different from csat user jack divita please correct me on this but enterpret user sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticketinteraction satisfaction rating will be the customers response to the csat survey agent gt please correct me on this but enterpret user sentiment analyzes the customer sentiment through the ticketinteraction satisfaction rating will be the customers response to the csat survey this is exactly correct user thanks jack divita do you know if it would also be possible to track the sentiment change within an interaction agent currently not possible but this is not the first time we have heard this request have raised it with the engineering team and there will be exploration on the feasibility in the coming weeks user thanks if this gets added to the roadmap can you let us know this could be a useful metric for us agent definitely before being added to the roadmap we will likely have some follow up questions on use cases and specific examples any additional detailsthoughts you can share on those would also be helpful user of course no problem positive gt negative does this lead to churn are there policies that are causing this change these can also be used to identify coaching opportunities negative gt positive identify tickets where an agent did an good job can be used to improve training or feedback for the agents agent gt does this lead to churn this one is doable today without analyzing intraticket sentiment changes we just need a little more data from notion agent meaning if you tell me which of your users churned and when i can tell you what problems they had before churning and how those compared vs users who have not churned this is a very common use case today user in order to tell you which users have churned and when wed probably have to pull subscription changes in from stripe which is managed by my team jack divita do you have any additional information about howwhat youd need from us to get churn data into enterpret i can ask my engineers if they have time for it agent the only thing i need is something to join it agains the feedback record for zendesk it looks like we have user email unique user id workspace id external user id for gong we have workspace id user id and email for forethought all i have is a record id i would also recommend including other additional metadata that might be useful for analysis sign up date churn date churned arr number of seats churned etc,0,2024-03-14T22:42:12Z,Slack,RecordTypeConversation,1.0

b5099fff-a377-5346-8e09-4ca0433cfcb1,user hey jack divita and enterpret team madison kohls is making changes to our zendesk model upstream from enterpret are there additional steps or changes you guys need to make to ensure it flows through the platform properly starting a thread agent it depends can you share more detail on the changes user we appended new columns to the table we sync over to you all nothing has been removed they are more metadata columns agent shouldnt be a problem on our end and ideally the data should just start flowing over naturally the only tricky part would be if you want us to backfill the existing data we have already ingested with the new metadata or to only have it populated moving forward user backfilling would be great i backfilled the table on our end so curious how that would work for you all agent its doable but i will need to get my engineering team involved let me check back with them to see what might be needed to get this done when did these changes go into effect asking with the real intention of checking to see what columns were added to confirm i am ingesting them user i believe yesterday agent whats a new column i should look for user ticketcontactreasontag agent hmmm i am not seeing any data with that present yet but i think you havent synced any data to us today yet either ill check back after the sync agent madison kohls we have not ingested any new data with this additional metadata because we have not ingested any new data since feb checked with my eng team and we are actually getting an authorization error for customerfeedbacktickets could this be related to the change you made user let me flag this to those who supported my change user i can confirm the dbt job has been running successfully and materializing of ok created sql incremental model enterpretshareddatapubliccustomerfeedbackticketsmaterialized success in s while not very familiar with enterpret ui i dont see any error messages there either we can loop in di if needed agent is there anything that would have changed with the permissions or authentication in the last days agent for reference here is the article for how the integration works on our side strictlink user i see let me check the exposures user the table was recreated yesterday for the backfill so it seems likely that some permission changed somehow user hi subteamsmflsm i see the environment associated with enterpret uses the now defunct etl role see strictlink could someone from di please replace the role in the job if that is in fact the issue and also update the ownership of the tables in question urgency medium user hi jack divita could you help me understand how i can find out the connection details user role etc from the ui user michael wu do you happen to know how enterpret connection is set up user it doesnt let me edit the configuration im guessing you can only see it on creation user i was expecting at least an enterpret user and a role in snowflake but i cant find any user on di side the credentials are created here strictlink these credentials work on a separate reader account created here strictlink and so if were to debug query history wed have to see the query history from within the reader account user ah got it ill try there agent gt it doesnt let me edit the configuration im guessing you can only see it on creation i believe this is the case as well i am looping a couple engineers from our side to help with this as well ideally we would be able to update the credentials of the existing integrations perhaps something we can do on our backend as needed thinkingface because i would want to avoid resyncing the entire table cc ishita mundhra vivek kaushal can we help figma correctdebug this user i can see the problem being not the auth i can log in with the same credentials and i see query history from today but theres only customerfeedbackreviews not the other one and that could be the problem agent we havent seen any issues with customerfeedbackreviews just customerfeedbacktickets user this is fixed now the issue is that when a view is recreated the grant to the reader account is not applied automatically and theres no way to automate that future grants to shares are not allowed so as long as we dont manually recreate views well be good user note for ds would be to inform di when a fullrefresh is performed for enterpret tables thanks peng wang agent amazing thank you all for your help i will monitor from our side to see when we see the data flowing again user yazad khambata can we document this somewhere so we can simply point data infra oncall to the few commands they need to run user i will ping you privately,0,2024-02-28T19:48:29Z,Slack,RecordTypeConversation,0.0

dbe439c0-9530-5976-8318-3fc06b10bd1b,agent hey team please find some feedback from float will add the gong call in the replys thanks for your understanding on the call looking forward to staying in touch heres some of our teams verbatims from the trial gt heres my early thoughts questions on enterpret as im going through gt so it pulls and creates summaries from our customer feedback channels based on keywords we specifically tag or can it tag automatically based on the nature of customer feedback eg if were not tracking agency or billable hours it can still search create a summary based on that pretty powerful if so edit it can thats awesome this feature alone will solidify amp finalise my agency positioning work raisedhandsipskintone gt i love that the feedback summary can be created based on feedback from a specific time period last months is the perfect preset for what im working on gt the sentiment analysis is brilliant too being able to see filter based on this is very helpful for answering questions about why people did or didnt switch to float how were currently serving a particular group gt email subscription is a great win too as itll help centralise insights in a given period in one place so i can share them internally gt gt gt gt gt curious to learn about its analytics and reporting capabilities how confident do we feel we can trust the data and summaries it provides us especially if were going to be making key big product x marketing bets from this gt quantify sum of mrr x feedback reason this is gold showing the mrr impactchurn from each feedback reason is powerful enables us to build better features x marketing that serves our best fit customers gt segmentation is a key component here though would like to see how far we can drill into each reason and split it by market segment use case mrr etc gt gt gt gt gt overall i think its better than what we have for sure based on its centralised customer feedback analysis features unsure how much it costs but i imagine its a lowtomid figure acv product based on the functionality on show here gt gt questions to ask here to move forward from my perspective gt does it require someone to manually feed the model every week to continue getting good results eg building the taxonomy and merging reasons into perpetuity etc seems like a timeconsuming job for a poor soul sweatsmile gt how can we use it to help inform our product x pmm okrs like figma did at company level gt for queries that are hyperspecific and new eg timezones etc the data amp summaries it provides will certainly be more surfacelevel compared to items around billing allocations other core product features gt can this be replicated with a customgpt from open ai could we feed it all our data and have it spit out what we need gt gt gt gt gt other than that i think its very powerful we just need to set it up right gt the summary inevitably endup me wanting to know more gt gt example gt issue with adding project dates gt the summary returned gt the feedback on float indicates that users are experiencing difficulties when trying to add start and end dates to their projects gt confusion over adding project dates users have reported an issue with adding project dates gt they are unsure about how to find and set the start and end dates for their projects gt this confusion is prevalent among users leading to difficulties in project management gt gt gt which is fine but of course gives me no context as to why or what they are trying to achieve gt but i was also a little surprised to see only feedback records over mth period thinkingface gt gt i do like that it pulls in community slack records would this act as a permanent store for this data that alone could be worth the cost gt gt over in quantify gt i tried filtering on keywords like google calendar and api all strictlink saw was a lot of support conversations which are not particularly useful to me gt gt im still left wondering if our numbers are too small to be meaningful im concerned the summary statements are confidently expressed based on or pieces of feedback gt gt also not really sure how this ties into a feature request system theres something appealing to me to know we have requests logged somewhere ideally with some product thinking notes jotted down but crucially with some verbatim comments from customers if this is going to reinterpret the results everytime and pull out maybe thats a good thing but its going to be hard to grasp what a request is gt im impressed with the concept of searching for terms and then being able to filter results to get to a data set that you can then dig into if we are searching on the full range of user feedback from all tools as it looks to be thats very powerful and a huge timesaver right there gt gt my main concerns are gt confidence that we are searching all data sources and not missing anything gt confidence that the ai is interpreting feedback as we would i found that when i put a csv of user feedback through chatgpt for rates and asked it to group the themes and tally them it struggled to do this as well as one of us would it was likely lacking a lot of context around the terms we use for the app industry terms and then oftentimes a word means something different in the sentence because resource planning calendar they can all be applied in very different contexts gt loe to keep it well fed with data and context who owns this gt how it connects to feature requests gt gt gt on the last point connecting to feature requests could we import our feature requests list from linear and then have the ai link any relevant feedback to each request in enterpret then we could pull up a feature request in enterpret and see all the related user feedback including the customers that have requested it if we can then dismiss inaccurate links presumably the model can improve at making good connections gt gt would be pretty cool if that is integrated so person adds a feature request in linear enterpret autolinks all relevant user feedback to the request in enterpret then its all their ready when we evaluate the request gt looks pretty slick i was looking for feedback related to placeholders yesterday and it was very helpful gt its great you can open intercom amp gong conversations and have the relevant conversation part immediately available gt it did seem like we need to do some gardeningadd some data sources but im very impressed seeing this v experience gt the ability to search and filter by sentiment customercompany attributes like mrr is huuuuuuge raisedhands gt importing everything seems to create some noise eg i dont need to see all the feedback about payment declines but it looks like we can filter that out and create dashboards ourselves gt it looks like its importing intercom conversation tags which we could use to setup a process with cs to help here agent

dd7a0d57-5ad4-54e7-91aa-49962da93902,user jack divita vivek kaushal sending a little inspiration your way i am testing out using chatgpt to analyze some old survey data i uploaded the csv with the prompt provide a summary for the most common things that are keeping people from remote recording today include counts when possible the response it gave me back was very much the sort of response i was expectingdesiring to get back when testing out the new wisdom experience in enterpret user heres the response gt the analysis of survey responses regarding whats currently keeping people from remote recording today reveals a wide variety of reasons with each unique reason mentioned by only one respondent indicating a high degree of specificity and diversity in the barriers faced here are some insights based on the data gt unique reasons there are unique reasons mentioned for not recording remotely some of these include not having the function yet procrastination uncertainty about where to record not being ready to coordinate with others needing an easier solution not having equipment and just not getting around to creating content of this kind gt keyword insights by analyzing the frequency of words used in the responses after removing common stopwords we find several key themes gt need mentions a significant number of respondents indicate a need for something possibly resources information or capabilities that they currently lack gt time and preparation mentions combined words like yet time havent and no suggest that issues related to timing readiness and availability of resources are common barriers gt technical and process uncertainty mentions of how the frequency of the word how suggests that uncertainty about the process or technical aspects of remote recording is a barrier for some gt procrastination and motivation the mention of procrastinating as a reason along with the implicit suggestion of delay in words like yet and havent points to procrastination or a lack of motivation as factors gt gt these insights indicate a complex landscape of barriers to remote recording including technical challenges lack of resources timing and readiness issues and motivational factors each respondent appears to have a unique set of challenges underscoring the need for tailored solutions to address these barriers agent really appreciate the inspiration and the feedback here mike mcnasby prayipskintone cc arnav sharma cto agent mike mcnasby thanks for sharing doing a quick comparison against wisdom today here was the response the analysis

the citations to see the quotes themselves agent but even having the ciations in this case i assume is actually not as useful because we didnt quite understand the question correctly we anchored on general complaints remote recording instead of focusing on what users said was preventing them from using it,0,2024-02-15T20:10:26Z,Slack,RecordTypeConversation,0.0

14c1e907-a1a5-576a-a461-dabd9d766f28,user were seeing a weird mismatch between our zendesk tickets and how enterpret visualizes the tickets specifically on zendesk we see a big spike in tickets on feb see nd image but through enterpret it looks like theres not a spike until feb what could be driving that difference is there a day lag in when enterpret gets the tickets if not what else could be driving this difference does this only assess sentiment analysis on first contact or does each subsequent contact get a sentiment analysis would love your thoughts on this jack divita user molly jane nicholas do you know if the zendesk tickets are looking at ticket creation date or ticket resolution date user laura perea heath rogers do either of you know the answer to the above user kait schorr has been looking into the snowflake gt enterpret pipeline and might have a pov agent this delay wouldnt be coming from our side that being said at a glance i suspect the root cause is that you are sending us the close date as the created date user im looking into this more today ill focus on zendesk differences this is helpful user im going to put together a doc of my findings for both sources and hopefully we can find someone to own it long term so we dont have the ambiguity around troubleshooting feel free to send me any details or weirdness youre observing user fwiw my hypothesis is the state in which entepret ingest the tickets is different from the state in which zendesk is reporting the ticket dates user the state of the ticket itself i think i remember someone maybe you mentioning that i will investigate that angle as well user this is already helpful all it does seem clear that its related to the state and not some weird issue with incorrectly tagging so ill communicate that back to the team user molly jane nicholas i dont know that was one of my questions norman lemke can you work with kait schorr on this user the mode dash should be by creation date norman lemke to confirm user so if enterpret is indeed close date it would be nice to switch that to match jack divita michael nguyen user i would also be very interested in seeing sentiment on creation date and sentiment of close date to see if there was a change throughout the life cycle of the ticket agent kait schorr when looking at the snowflake table there will be two date fields that are required by us for ingestion erccreatedat the creation timestamp of the feedback ercrowcreatedat the creation timestamp of the row in the table helps enterpret track what data to ingest can you confirm that on your side the erccreatedat is being mapped to the created date of the ticket itself here is the link to the full documentation of our snowflake integration if that is helpful strictlink user yes looking now user so erccreatedat is actually using the updatedat date of the ticket user also the zendesk tickets are also being filtered by the feedbackprohibiteddomains table agent kait schorr can we correct the dates we can help run a backfill on our end also is that the only filter on the table michael nguyen do we still need the prohibited domains filter would it be possible to connect love sometime this week id want to make sure we are all on the same page and that any updates we make fully solve the problem so that we are not still working through this a few weeks from now user the filters ive found are these userid is not null ticket status in closed solved hold userfacts domain not in prohibited domains user one thing to note is we are in the middle of pulling data for an exec review meeting tomorrow so unless its a quick fix we should hold michael nguyen jack divita user madison kohls perhaps we can capture this request to change the erccreatedat to be the date the ticket was created not the updatedat date in your current doc of proposed changes to the query user michael nguyen yup this seems to be from a model built downstream of the query i am proposing it seems like regardless we need to change the field from updatedat to createdat in this downstream model user which query are you proposing changing madison kohls user nvm norman lemke sent it to me we should definitely set up some time to align on this user yes let me find a time for us michael and norman so i can give better context smile,0,2024-02-12T23:33:57Z,Slack,RecordTypeConversation,0.0

00882ddb-6441-54d0-8c56-62c2024a53f8,agent michael nguyen starting this thread to follow up on something we were chatting about the other day i think we need a clear definition and owner of the snowflake tables that are currently being ingested into enterpret we need clarity on what data is being analyzed and even more importantly what data is not being analyzed we need to know who to go to when we want to make changes to the data model a from my conversation with the support team this week there are new dimensions of metadata that we would want to bring in currently there are two snowflake tables that are being brought in to enterpret snowflake customerfeedbacktickets database name enterpretshareddata this is zendesk data snowflake customerfeedbackreviews database name enterpretshareddata customer feedback reviews table name customerfeedbackreviews these are asana feedback tickets govoc for both sources we are ingesting a value for ercid which best as i know represents the unique id for each record on the figma side based on previous conversations i know that we are not being sent every single record for each of these sources but it is not clear what the criteria being used to determine what records are sent to us even if we do not change this definition i think it will be very helpful for everyone involved if we can atleast share this definition i have included some analysis from my side to help with this investigation but ultimately we will need someone from the figma data engineering team to own this for the zendesk erc ids they appear to be sequential and make me think that you are sending us roughly of tickets the asana ticket ids do not appear to be sequential spreadsheet with extract of ticket ids strictlink who would be the right person to ask about this and to own this moving forward from the figma team is there any other data i can provide from the enterpret side to help with this user hey jack thanks for putting this together i will hop in and help figure this out or at least hunt down an owner agent amazing thank you so much please let me know if there is anything else i can do to help user thank you so much kait schorr this is gonna be a huge win for us prayipskintone user looking into the asana tickets so customerfeedbackreviews and they arent actually incremental they are randomly generated unique numbers so the gaps between the numbers doesnt signify missing tickets the ercid is indeed the task id number though and you can only see it when youre using asana in the browser its the last bit of the url user yup but see examples in previous threads where we are missing some tickets and we dont understand why user understood im still digging into it just wanted to share that finding since the spreadsheet was calculating the jumps between asana tickets as well im looking at the queries and i will trace them from the source and see wherewhy things are dropping off user for the asana tickets anything from the following domains is filtered out according to the query user as well as only tickets generated in this project id creditcard name voc needs,0,2024-02-07T23:41:55Z,Slack,RecordTypeConversation,1.0
